<div class="verse">
Oh, dear Heavens why you're so green?<br>
more beautiful than anything I've ever seen<br>
there's no place this pretty i've ever been to<br>
and to your existence we have no clue.
</div>

<div class="verse">
oh, dear Heaven, do you have fairies?<br>
i have heard a lot of stories<br>
but i couldn't find you<br>
oh, your sky so blue.
</div>

<div class="verse">
oh, dear Heavens, do people still visit you?<br>
i think no one is that good<br>
this place is what God drew<br>
it has living trees not wood.
